## What I do

Palantir built the ontology-first operating system for defense and government. I'm building the same thing for everyone else.

**Syntaxia** brings data-centric architecture to commercial enterprises: ontologies, knowledge graphs, semantic drift detection. The problems Palantir solved for three-letter agencies exist in every company with more than a few systems. Different data, same entropy.

I like to:

- design **simple, reliable architectures** instead of fragile patchworks
- build systems that combine data, AI, and human insight effectively
- ship things that hold up under real-world load and business pressure
- stay focused on production-ready systems that last

**Main stack**

- **Backend / product:** Nix, Ruby on Rails, Python, Java  
- **Glue & automation:** Shell, data pipelines, orchestration  
- **Focus areas:** data platforms, semantic layers, RAG/graphRAG, AI-ready SaaS, RDF, OWL

## How I think

A lot of my work is about reducing **accidental complexity**:

- model the domain clearly (people, entities, relationships, constraints)  
- keep the **semantic layer** explicit instead of hiding logic in dashboards  
- combine LLMs with solid data foundations instead of trusting "magic"  

If you've ever felt like your systems are a pile of duct tape and meeting notes, that's the kind of chaos I enjoy cleaning up.

## ✍️ Against Entropy

I write **Against Entropy** for engineers and founders building data systems who want honest analysis over vendor talking points.

What I cover:

- semantic drift: when your data stops meaning what you think it means
- knowledge graphs, ontologies, and data-centric architecture
- Snowflake optimization and cloud cost reduction
- the gaps in the modern data stack that nobody talks about

Everything I publish is written by hand. No AI generation. Writing is how I think, not just how I communicate. When I sit down to write an essay, I'm working through the problem, not transcribing a solution I already have. That process produces insights I wouldn't reach otherwise.

I also believe readers deserve to know what they're getting. If you're reading my work, you're reading my experience, my mistakes, my actual point of view. Not a language model's interpolation of the internet.
